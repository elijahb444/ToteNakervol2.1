#ToteNaker  (Note Taker)

## Description
This project served to properly introduce me to vital aspects for constructing a backend for an application, particularly using routing methods such as POST and GET, as well as updating/writing to a database with user information. I also used npm and node for package install and functionality.
It's meant to work as a program that would allow a user to write notes to themselves, store the to a database, then display the notes on a sidebar for easy access should a user have to go back and check what they wrote.

(Unfortunately I could not, for the life of me, figure out how to get the notes to display using the frontend provided. I feel as though the issue is staring me in the face. However the server's retrieval and returning of data works as intended.)

This was a fun project, though the routing syntax took some getting used to. Regardless, I'm excited to implement these methods in future projects.
